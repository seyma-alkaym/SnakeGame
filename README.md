## Overview

This project is a C# Windows Forms application that features a simple snake game. The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat objects to achieve the highest score.

## How to Play

- Press the "B" key to start the game.
- You can pause and resume the game using the "D" key.
- Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake up, down, left, or right.
- When the snake eats an object, you earn points. Your score increases based on how quickly you consume objects.
- You are required to enter a name before starting the game. Your score will be saved with this name when the game ends.

## Game Rules

- The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries of the panel or collides with its own tail.
- With each object you eat, the snake grows a bit longer.
- Objects are placed at random locations and must be eaten within a certain time to earn a saved score.
